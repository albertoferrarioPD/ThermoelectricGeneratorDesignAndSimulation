# ThermoelectricGeneratorSimulation
Graphical User Interface to design and simulate thermoelectric generators.

TeGDS is a program developed in Matlab to easily simulate and analyse the performance of a thermoelectric generator as a function of temperature, by describing temperature dependent material properties, geometry and other interface materials. The program uses an iterative algorithm that, starting from external temperatures, evaluate the temperature losses in passive elements and corrects the effective temperatures on thermoelectric elements.

This simulation tool allows to design a thermoelectric generator with new material data and to optimize the geometry by adjusting parameters. It can also be used to compare experimental data of new or commercial module in operating conditions or to study the effects of interface layers

The GUI is build with App Designer in Matlab 2018a.
